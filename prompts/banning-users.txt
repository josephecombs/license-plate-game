I have a user in prod who logged in and spammed all 51 states.

obviously this is illegitimate so I need you to do a few steps to implement the ability to ban and purge a user's info.

step 1:
in the reports page, if logged in as an admin, create a "more actions" button next to email that when clicked opens a modal for now with lorem ipsum

step 2:
on the reports page, if the user has the attribute banned: true, add a list at the very bottom of the page with all banned users

step 3
inside the modal, remove the lorem and add a button with an alert confirmation that asks an admin to confirm if they'd like to ban a user and purge their info from the system pick a route that makes sense but don't implement controller or anything quite yet

step 3a
add the attribute "bannedAt" to user and change the logic of the reports page to filter for the bannedAt timestamp. rather than banned. you may need to write a wrangler migration so tell me how to add this property to a durable object USER

step 4
implement 2 new endpoints: "users/ban", and "users/unban" (maybe nested somewhere idk) - PUT json with the format:

{email: email_address@here.com}

make the endpoints actually toggle the state of the "bannedAt" attribute on to the UTC time or undefined depending on if youre banning or unbanning.
